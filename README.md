# The story of the empty repository
As i was working on my Machine learning and natural language processing assignments, it was brought to my attention, that this repository conatains no ```README.md``` file. 
What a grave oversight on my part, for leaving this poor repository stranded for 2 years without a single commit ðŸ˜¥.

## Getting Started
In order to have acces to this awesome ```README.md``` file, you have to run the following commands:
* Open the folder where you'd like to have the file in your terminal
* Run ```git clone <repository-link>```
* Step 3: Profit ðŸ”¥
